==================================

Ai Module x Screens Course - year 02023

The field of artificial intelligence is in flux with very exciting and sometimes terrifying developments happening every week. This module is a very hands on designerly approach to give you the tools, references, histories, etc. so you can feel the pulse of the field. The module is structured thematically in 3 weeks:

* 13.March to 20.March -> Ai x LastWeek 
* 21.March to 27.March -> Ai x ThisWeek  
* 28.March to 31.March -> Ai x NextWeek 

Please consider participating in this creative coding competition - you have amazing skills, let the world know and get some cash in the process!

## Ai x LastWeek

This week we learn about Ai and its short but complex history. First we will spend some days having fun with [P5.js](https://p5js.org/), a javascript library for creative coding that has lots of Ai and Machine Learning examples. At the end of the week we will explore Ai and Machine Learning by redesigning and mixing lots of existing code. 

_______________________________________________

### Monday 13.March
**Intro to this Ai module ++ P5.js**

We will be using [p5.js](http://www.p5js.org/), a JavaScript framework for creative coding. No need to use anything other than Google [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and the web [P5.js editor](https://editor.p5js.org/) -> **Please make an account!**

There is also the possibility of running everything on your own computer -> https://p5js.org/get-started/ (scroll all the way down)
In the morning we will be learning about the basics of programming in p5.js + how make things interactive + loops.
_In the afternoon we will have a hands-on session with these resources:_
* Go to whenever there are doubts : p5.js reference https://p5js.org/reference/

## Ai x ThisWeek
The rest of this week will be devoted to engaging with the two most releant content generation tools in the current Ai landscape: ChatGPT and Dalle-2. We will use these systems as case studies of complex Ai systems that need to be interacted with through text snippets or prompts. The design of prompts is not a straightforward affair so we will spend some time learning how to better match the descriptions with the content we want to produce. 

_______________________________________________


### Wednesday 22.March

Today will be about generative ai with mainstream tools and some theories about prompt design.

_Brief for today_

Design the storyboard of the short film titled “Endless Gratitude” in pairs or on your own.  Future horizon is 2023.
The visual style is your choice - realistic, animation, etc but it should have some color. 
Format is free - can be a4 smaller or larger too. Minimum 13 pages (should be easy because some pages might be close ups for emphasis,etc)
Text generated with ChatGPT
Images should be consistent and can be generated with any tech - Dalle2, Midjourney,etc
Bonus: what is the soundtrack like? Find a song or two for the presentation on Friday.
Presentations Friday at 11:00

## Ai x NextWeek

In the last week of the course we turn ourselves towards the ultra-near-future. What lies around the Ai corner? We will learn about Ai ethics and speculative design with a focus on potential intersections between Ai and Design. 
_______________________________________________

### Monday 27.March
**Speculative Ai Design**

Today we will explore the different ways in which design and Ai overlap with a focus on using Ai as a design material. We will then learn about speculative design fiction and will introduce the final design task of this module. 

Brief deliverables:
 
1.- What if? And weak signals that led you to it
2. Interface - better if interactive - figma might be best
3. Speculative/Design Fiction(s)
